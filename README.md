I am editing the README file. Adding some more details about the project description.# Problem-Solving Repository

## About
This repository contains my problem-solving solutions in **C++**, demonstrating my skills in:
- Arrays & Loops
- Strings & String Manipulation
- Sorting & Searching Algorithms
- Graphs, Hashing, and Dynamic Programming
- Advanced Data Structures (Trie, Z-algorithm, etc.)
- Problem-solving on **HackerRank**

All solutions are organized by **topic and difficulty level**, ready for scholarship review.

## Repository Structure
- **Arrays:** Basic and medium-level problems with arrays and loops  
- **Strings:** String manipulation problems (palindrome, anagram, pattern matching, Z-algorithm)  
- **Advanced:** Graphs, Hashing, DP, and other advanced algorithms
